## Repository Overview

- This project is a development of a small set of [Backbase Service SDK](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/ServiceSDK/latest/index) (**Spring Boot** and **Cloud**) based Microservices projects that implement cloud-native intuitive, Microservices design patterns, and coding best practices.
- The project follows [**CloudNative**](https://www.cncf.io/) recommendations and the [**twelve-factor app**](https://12factor.net/) methodology for building *software-as-a-service apps* to show how Î¼Services should be developed and deployed.
- This project uses technologies broadly used in Backbase.Like Docker, Kubernetes, Java SE 11, Spring Boot, Spring Cloud
- 'cards-presentation-service' has been generated using `core-service-archetype` - [Community guide](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/ServiceSDK/latest/create_a_core_service)
- This service implements logic for the UI components (Widget/Journey) to view and manage bank customer cards. Service integrates with [Marqeta](https://www.marqeta.com) card issuer.
- The service is implementation of `card-manager-client-api` - https://repo.backbase.com/specs/card-manager/
- Refer to [workflow guide](https://github.com/baas-devops-reference/docs/tree/master/backend) for Backend CI Workflow documentation

              name: marqeta-credentials
              key: username
        marqeta.password:
          valueFrom:

            configMapKeyRef:
              name: marqeta-env
              key: basePath
```
#### Marqeta config
The following properties **must** be set as they have no default:

Property | Description
--- | ---
**marqueta.baseUrl** | Base URL of Marqueta API (i.e. `https://sandbox-api.marqeta.com/v3`)
**marqueta.username** | API username
**marqueta.password** | API password

#### Stream config (if applicable)
Configuration properties used by Stream to interact with Backbase services (DBS, Token converter...).

Not applicable for 'cards-presentation-service'
---
## Customisation in project
CVV validation is not done as part this project due to testing complexity but can be added using marqeta getCvv api if required.
### Configuration changes
If project adopts Marqeta, only Marqeta configuration properties has to be changed.

### Component changes
If project adopts a different vendor than Marqeta, all services from `com.backbase.productled.service` package have to be replaced.

## Getting Started
### BaaS setup

- [ ] Step 1: Modify https://github.com/baas-devops-reference/ref-self-service/blob/main/self-service.tfvars by adding to `ecr` list name of new repository: `cards-presentation-service'
- [ ] Step 2: Checkout the following repository: https://github.com/baas-devops-reference/ref-applications-live/blob/main/runtimes/dev/basic-installation.yaml apply your deployment configurations example see _DSC (basic-installation.yml) configuration_ above.
- [ ] Step 3: Run the pre-commit to validate the configurations => ` pre-commit run --all-files --show-diff-on-failure --color=always`
- [ ] Step 4: Commit and Push your changes; wait for the template rendering and lint jobs to complete
- [ ] Step 5: Merge into `master` to trigger deployment.

### Local setup

- [ ] Step 1: Ensure to check the prerequisites for [local developer environment](https://community.backbase.com/documentation/ServiceSDK/latest/create_developer_environment)
- [ ] Step 2: Run command => `mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=local`
- [ ] Step 3: To run the service from the built binaries, use => `java -jar target/cards-presentation-service-1.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar -Dspring.profiles.active=local`
